ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange

ReWear is a web-based platform that promotes sustainable fashion by enabling users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. Our mission is to reduce textile waste and encourage conscious consumption by making second-hand clothing stylish, social, and simple.
